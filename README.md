## Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also known as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were relatively rare. This dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze the diversity of microbial life found in human belly buttons.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an engaging way to explore the dataset, allowing users to select different samples and view corresponding charts and demographic information about the microbial species present. By interacting with the dashboard, users can gain insights into the distribution and prevalence of various microbes.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu**: Users can select different samples from a dropdown menu to view specific data related to that sample.
- **Interactive Charts**: The dashboard includes various visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, that display the composition of microbial species for the selected sample.
- **Demographic Information**: Alongside the charts, the dashboard presents demographic information about the sample, providing context for the data.
